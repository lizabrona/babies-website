					<h2>Development from 6 to 12 months</h2>
				</header>
				</br>
				<p>Look at your baby go! He's become an eager explorer, and it might surprise you how quickly he can get around when he crawls or scoots.
				He can sit on his own now and grabs anything he can to pull himself up to standing and "cruise." He might even take some solo steps before his first birthday.
				His babbling sounds more like real conversation, and you'll hear his first words – often "mama" or "dada."
				Soon he'll talk in simple phrases, but in the meantime he uses gestures to indicate what he wants – or doesn't want!
				– and pays close attention to your words.
				His hands are increasingly nimble: He amuses himself putting things in containers and taking them out again.
				He can use his thumb and finger in a pincer grasp to eat finger food.
				Your baby loves to be just like you by combing his own hair, drinking from a cup, and pretending to talk on the phone.
				While he may seem outgoing, he's probably reserved around strangers. And when you leave him, he may become distraught –
				separation anxiety is normal at this age.

					<h3>What you can do</h3>
				</header>
				<p>Keep talking to your baby: This is a critical time for his language development. Describe your routine, what you're doing now and what you're going to do next, and what you see.
				Describing how you think your baby is feeling helps him learn emotions. Keep reading together and play peekaboo, hide-and-seek, and turn-taking games.
				As he gets more active, it's important to provide a safe space to explore. He may not be walking quite yet, but you can help him get ready by holding him in a way that puts weight on his legs or by propping him up against the sofa.
				Pay attention to what he enjoys, and give him the freedom to use all his senses to play and discover.
				Offer him crayons and paper, stacking blocks, empty food containers, and pots and pans to play with.
				Praise and reward good behavior. If he gets into mischief, a brief "no" and redirection is usually enough.
				Although he's too young to understand and obey rules, you can start showing him which behaviors aren't allowed and helping him find more appropriate activities.</p>

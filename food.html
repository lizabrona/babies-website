					<h2>Healthy food for you and your child</h2>
				</header>
				<br/>
				<p>A balanced diet is one that contains a wide variety of foods, eaten in different combinations, every day.
				By eating lots of different things, a balanced diet helps to give your toddler all the nutrients he needs.
				This means that you don't have to worry about your toddler lacking something essential in his food.  </p>
				</br>
				<p>
				To help your toddler eat well, give him a variety of foods from all of the following groups</p>
				<br/>
				<table>
				<tr>
					<th id="foodgroup">Food group</th>
					<th id="products">Products</th>
					<th id="advice"></th>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Starchy foods</td>
					<td>Cereals, pasta, rice, potatoes, bread</td>
					<td>Your toddler may not like wholegrain starchy foods, so try to offer a mix of wholegrain and non-wholegrain foods.
						Doing this will also prevent him from feeling too full from high-fibre foods to get a good range of nutrients. </td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Fruit and vegetables</td>
					<td>Any fruits and vegetables as long as they are not cousing any allergies</td>
					<td>Getting your toddler to eat a variety of fruit, and especially vegetables, can be a challenge.
						Keep offering them to your toddler so that he learns they are a normal part of a meal.
						You can also experiment with unusual fruit, such as starfruit, to keep your toddler interested.
						Or offer a plate of different-coloured fruit to tempt him, such as banana, kiwi fruit, blueberries, and strawberries</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>High-iron and high-protein foods</td>
					<td>Meat, fish, eggs, nuts, beans</td>
					<td>Make sure that any meat products you buy are high-quality, and are made of lean meat with low amounts of added salt.
						Meatballs and fishcakes are children's favorite food. 
				</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Dairy food</td>
					<td>Cheese, milk, yougurt</td>
					<td>Milk is still a good source of calcium for your toddler, but he doesn't need as much as he did when he was a baby.
						Aim to give your toddler around 350ml (two thirds of a pint) of milk a day.
						It's best not to give him more than this as it will reduce his appetite for other foods. </td>

			<h4>Food you should limit</h4>

			<ul> 
				<li>Food high in fat and sugar. Large amounts of butter, oils, cakes and biscuits can make him ovrweight.</li>
				<li>Sweets and chocolate. shouldn't be eaten every day. Sugary foods contain little or no goodness and can spoil your toddler's appetite.
				They can also damage his teeth. </li>
				<li>Salty foods. Keep crisps and salty snacks for an occasional treat - no more than once a week.
				Limit the number of ready-meals and takeaways that your toddler eats.</li>

					<h2>Development from 0 to 6 months</h2>
				</header>
				<p>Each child is unique and develops at her own pace. There's a wide range of what's considered normal,
			and you probably don't need to be concerned unless you notice one of the red flags described below.
			</p>

					<h3>1 month</h3>
				</header>
				<p>The first days with your baby can be a blur of feeding, changing diapers, settling her to sleep, and responding to her wails.
				But within a few weeks, she'll start to take more notice of your voice, face, and touch. 
				Your baby can't focus farther than 8 to 12 inches away – just the right distance for her to gaze at your face. 
				Black-and-white patterns also draw her attention. Her hearing is fully developed and she might turn toward familiar sounds, such as your voice.</p>

					<h3>3 months</h3>
				</header>
				<p>By now, you're basking in the warmth of your baby's delighted smiles! He actively enjoys playtime now,
				amusing you both when he imitates your facial expressions. He's starting to babble and mimic the sounds you make.
				You no longer need to support his head. When he's on his stomach, he can lift his head and chest, and even do the mini-pushups
				that set the stage for rolling over. He can open and close his hands, shake toys, swat at dangling objects, bring his hands to
				his mouth, and push down with his legs if you hold him in a standing position.
				His hand-eye coordination is improving. You'll notice him closely tracking objects that interest him and focusing
				intently on faces. He's able to recognize you from across the room!

					<h3>4 to 7 months</h3>
				</header>
				<p>Your baby is fully engaged with the world now:
				She smiles, laughs, and has babbling "conversations" with you. And she's on the move – by 7 months she can probably
				roll to her tummy and back again, sit without your help, and support her weight with her legs well enough to bounce when you hold her.
				She uses a raking grasp to pull objects closer and can hold toys and move them from one hand to another.
				Your baby is more sensitive to your tone of voice and may heed your warning when you tell her "no." 
				She also knows her name now and turns to look at you when you call her.

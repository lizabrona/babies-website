					<h3>Games to play with your one-year-old</h3>
				</header>
				<br/>
				<img id="slide" alt="Playing images" style="float:right;width:399px;height:224px;margin:10px;">
				<ul>
				<li id="string_along"><h4>String along.</h4> On a highchair tray or non-breakable plate, spread a thin layer of any kind of O-shaped cereal that has reasonably large holes. Cut a 50cm piece of string or plastic cord (sold in craft shops), or use a thin shoelace with plastic-coated ends. Tie a knot in one end, or tie the cord around a cereal-O, to prevent the others from slipping off.
				Show your toddler how to thread the cord through the cereal, then sit back and read the newspaper for a few minutes of uninterrupted peace. </li>
				<li id="package_play"><h4>Package play.</h4> With your toddler seated in the bath, distract him for a moment and use a wet flannel to "wrap" a small bath toy, such as a rubber duck or plastic dinosaur. Present him with the "package", saying, "I'm giving you a present."
				He'll unfold the flannel, squeal with delight, and immediately want to do it again. 
				If you have two flannels handy, you can start wrapping the next present while he's busy unwrapping the first one. </li>
				<li id="tupperware_party"><h4>Tupperware party.</h4>Clear a work area on the floor for your toddler, making sure she's well away from the hob if you'll be cooking. Spread out the containers and show her how the little ones fit inside the bigger ones.
				When she's not looking, hide the small items inside some of the plastic containers.
				As she explores, she'll be delighted with her "discoveries". </li>
				</ul>

					<h3>Games to play with your two-year-old</h3>
				</header>
				<br/>
				<ul>
				<li id="one_for_you"><h4>One for you, one for me.</h4> You can use anything you like for this game -- buttons, crayons, raisins.
				Give your toddler a small pile and ask him to share them out -- 'one for you, one for me' -- into some small containers or plates.
				Invite your partner, a little friend or his favourite teddy to join in, too, so he can practise sharing things out three ways.
				Your toddler will love being in charge -- and this game will help introduce him to numbers as well.  </li>
				<li id="picnic"><h4>Going on a picnic.</h4> Make an ordinary day more fun by having a picnic for lunch.
				You don't need to go out -- just spread a blanket on the sitting-room floor and eat from paper plates. 
				Prepare some finger food with your toddler -- mini sandwiches, vegetables sticks, hardboiled eggs, for example,
				and encourage him to pretend that you're somewhere more exciting, like up a mountain or by a stream.
				Your toddler will love using his imagination and it will also give you lots to talk about.  </li>
				<li id="where_this_go"><h4>Where does this go? </h4>Using old magazines cut out pictures of pieces of furniture -- chairs, TV, cooker, bed -- as well as other things you have around the house like a kettle, towels and books.
				Then cut out pictures of rooms -- a sitting room, dining room, garage, garden.
				Lay the pictures out on the floor and ask you toddler to help put all the pictures of the furniture and objects in the right room.
				Don't worry too much if he doesn't know or gets it wrong -- just see the game as a great chance to have a chat and encourage your toddlers conversational skills.  </li>

			<h4>Games to encourage your child's language skills</h4>
			</br>
			<hr>
			</br>
			<p>Make reading more interactive by pointing things out in the pictures: "This is a big dog, just like Grandma's dog."
			Or, "There's the baby's nose. And here's your nose!" 
			You can also let your toddler be the pointer, as you ask him, "Where's the moon?" or "Can you point to the green ball?"
			Your toddler might enjoy turning the pages himself.</p> 
			</br>
			<p>The nursery rhyme "This Little Piggy" has delighted kids and parents for generations. 
			This game is a fun way for your child to work on her rapidly developing language skills.
			It also provides some nice connection time for the two of you, which your child craves at this age.</p>

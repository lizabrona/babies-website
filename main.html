					<h3>Being a parent</h3>
				</header>
				<p>Being a parent is the best thing ever, but it is also the biggest challenge. Sometimes it seems overwhelming, but you can handle it. Just be patient,
				trust your instincts but in the same time try to learn as much as you can. Some mothers say: "I don't read parenting literature, I'm just following my instincts."
				Well this is good, but what you instincts know about heathy eating or child emergency medical treatment?. On the other hand you don't need to follow 
				all the instructions given in parenting books, use your own judgment, but you need to be as well informed as you can. This is your child, and you are responsible
				for his or hers heath and future. Here are some useful links:
